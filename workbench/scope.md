**Scope Document for AI Weather Agent**

**Project Description:**
- Build of a weather agent

**User Requirements:**

- Receive current weather information, including temperature, humidity, precipitation, and wind speed.
- Provide the user with a visually informative dashboard displaying the current weather conditions.

**System Architecture:**

**Core Components:**
- Weather data collector: Collects current weather data from relevant sources, such as weather APIs or local weather stations.
- Data pipeline: Translates and formats weather data into a consistent format for the weather agent.
- Data storage: Stores weather data in a data warehouse for future analysis or historical comparison.
- User interface: Provides a visual dashboard for displaying weather conditions.

**External Dependencies:**
- Weather APIs: APIs or other external data sources for weather data.
- Data visualization library: Library for creating and displaying weather data visualizations.

**Testing Strategy:**

**Unit Tests:**
- Test individual components of the weather agent.
- Test data formatting and retrieval from external sources.

**Integration Tests:**
- Test the weather agent's communication with the data pipeline and data warehouse.
- Test the user interface's functionality.

**End-to-End Testing:**
- Execute the weather data collection, processing, storage, and visualization processes to ensure the entire system functions correctly.

**Documentation:**

- Architecture Diagrams: Visual representation of the system architecture, showing data flow, components, and dependencies.
- Core Components: Detailed descriptions of individual components, including their functionality and interfaces.
- External Dependencies: List of external dependencies and their versions.
- Testing Strategy: Outline the testing steps and procedures for each component and the overall system.
